    Despite the name of this function, it does not translate into a single database hit,
    unfortunatelly. But it is still better than a loop executing `Model.objects.get_or_create`
    in every iteration.

    That's because this function **combines filters and the bulk_create method**.
    Django querysets are lazy, but in this function they are evaluated on every iteration.
    However, in the end **only one** `INSERT` query is performed.

    ---

    #### Important!
    Django's `Model.objects.bulk_create` method returns a list of newly created instances **without ids**
    when working with SQLite. Please, make sure to use PostgreSQL to avoid problems.

    ---

    It expects the following parameters:

    - `klass` -> The model whose values will be retrieved or created
    - `values` -> A list of dictionaries having key value pairs demanded by `klass`
    - `only_create` -> A boolean value. Defaults to `False`. In case you don't care about getting
    existing values, and just wants to create them, then you can set this arguments to `True`. It
    will result in just one database hit.
    - `kwargs` -> Key value pairs with extra fields you want to use for filtering/creating instances
    of `klass`. It can be useful for foreign key fields

    Usage example:

    ---

    ```python

    # serializers.py

    from awesome_tools.helpers import bulk_get_or_create, set_and_destroy


    class MovieSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        # ...

        def create(self, validated_data: dict) -> Movie:
            # ...

            videos_data = validated_data.pop("videos")

            # ...

            bulk_get_or_create(Video, videos_data, movie=movie)

            # ...

        def update(self, instance: Movie, validated_data: dict) -> Movie:
            # ...

            videos = validated_data.pop("videos", None)

            # ...

            if videos:
                set_and_destroy(
                    klass=instance,
                    attr="videos",
                    value=bulk_get_or_create(Video, videos, movie=instance),
                    related_klass=Video,
                    movie=None,
                )

            # ...
    ```

    Note that in the `update` method, we are combining `set_and_destroy` with `bulk_get_or_create`.
    That's totally a thing.

    happening under the hood. It's not complicated.

    from crashing. For instance, in case you want to get an object by it's primary key, and
    it is of type `uuid`, but another data type is provided in the url, it will not crash,
    unlike the standard `get_object_or_404`. It expects the following arguments:

    - `klass` -> The model that will be used for the query

    If no `exception` is provided, then the standard `django.http.Http404` class is used.
    - `**kwargs` -> Keyword arguments representing all fields that should be used for the
    search, as many as you please.

    Note that in case a room id is valid, but the cinema id is not, an appropriated message will be
    returned. In case you would use `get_object_or_404`, you would get just a `"Not found."`. Having
    more than one lookup field, `get_object_or_error` makes much clearer what is the problem.

    This function basically sets a new list of values in of a foreign key field and erases any
    previous values that were related to `klass`. For it to work, **you must set `null=True`

    It accepts the following parameters:

    - `klass` -> The model on the side `1` of a `1:N` relationship, the owner of the relation,
    in which the new values will be set
    - `attr` -> A string version of the attribute corresponding to the `related_name` value

    - `value` -> A list (or any other iterable), containing new created instances of `related_klass`
    - `related_klass` -> The model on the side `N` of a `1:N` relationship, the one having the foreign
    key field
    - `**kwargs` -> Keyword arguments used in a filter to determine which objects should be destroyed.
    It could be really anything, but usually you will want it to be something like `klass=None`, so
    that all objects that are no part of the relationship anymore can be descarded.

    For instance, a `Movie` may have many `Video`s related to it, like teasers and trailers. In case
    you want to update a `Movie`, reseting its `Video`s:

    one movie, since it doesn't make sense that two movies have the same trailer or teaser. So when
    assigning this new list of videos to a movie, the `set_and_destroy` function safely deletes all
    videos having their `movie` foreign key equal to `None`.
